                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a striking antelope species native to the arid regions of southern Africa,
                    such as the Kalahari Desert. It thrives in dry environments by obtaining moisture from the plants it consumes,
                    including grasses, roots, and tubers. These large herbivores are known for their long, sharp horns and distinct 
                    black-and-white facial markings. Gemsbok are well-adapted to extreme heat and can survive without drinking water
                    for extended periods, making them a symbol of desert survival. They typically live for 18 to 20 years in the wild.
