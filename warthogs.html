                <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                <p>Warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) are wild members
                of the pig family found in the savannas and grasslands
                of sub-Saharan Africa. Recognized by their large tusks
                and warty faces, warthogs may look fierce, but they
                are generally non-aggressive. They are omnivores,
                feeding on grass, roots, berries, and small animals.
                Warthogs often use their strong snouts to dig for
                food and take shelter in abandoned burrows, especially
                those made by aardvarks. When grazing, they frequently
                kneel on their front legs. Warthogs live for about 12
                to 15 years in the wild.
