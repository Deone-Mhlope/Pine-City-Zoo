                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <p>Gorillas are large, powerful primates native to the tropical
                    and subtropical forests of central Africa. There are two main
                    species: the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and the eastern
                    gorilla (Gorilla beringei). Gorillas are primarily herbivores,
                    feeding on fruits, leaves, and stems. They are highly intelligent,
                    capable of using tools and communicating through complex
                    vocalizations and gestures. Sharing about 98% of their DNA with
                    humans, gorillas are one of our closest relatives in the animal
                    kingdom. In the wild, they live around 35 to 40 years, and even
                    longer in captivity.
