                <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a rare
                    and beloved bear species native to the bamboo forests
                    of China. Despite being classified as carnivores,
                    pandas have adapted to a mostly vegetarian diet
                    consisting almost entirely of bamboo. They can eat
                    up to 38 kilograms of it each day! Their distinct
                    black-and-white fur and gentle nature make them a
                    favorite in zoos around the world. Pandas live in
                    mountainous regions and are considered a conservation
                    symbol due to their endangered status. In the wild,
                    pandas live up to 20 years, but in captivity, they
                    can live over 30 years.
