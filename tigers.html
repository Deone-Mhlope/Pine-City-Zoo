                <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                <p>Tigers (Panthera tigris) are the largest of all wild
                cats and are native to parts of Asia, including India,
                Russia, and Southeast Asia. Known for their striking
                orange coats with black stripes, each tiger has a
                unique pattern like a fingerprint. They are solitary,
                powerful predators that hunt deer, wild boar, and
                other large animals. Tigers are also strong swimmers
                and often cool off in water, unlike most other cats.
                They can live between 10 to 15 years in the wild.
                Sadly, all tiger subspecies are currently endangered
                due to habitat loss and poaching.
