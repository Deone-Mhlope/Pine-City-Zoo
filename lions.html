                <h3>LIONS</h3>
                <p>The lion (Panthera leo), often referred to as the
                "king of the jungle," is one of Africaâ€™s most
                iconic predators. Lions are unique among big
                cats in that they live in social groups called
                prides, which are led by a dominant male. They
                inhabit grasslands and savannas, preying on a
                variety of animals such as zebras, antelopes,
                and buffalo. Lions are carnivores and known
                for their powerful build and resounding roars
                that can be heard up to 8 kilometers away.
                In the wild, lions typically live between 10 to 14 years.
