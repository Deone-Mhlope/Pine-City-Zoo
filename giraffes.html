                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>Giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are the tallest land animals on Earth,
                    easily recognized by their extremely long necks and legs. They inhabit
                    the open woodlands and savannas of Africa, where they use their height 
                    to browse leaves from tall trees, especially acacias. Giraffes are herbivores
                    and rely on their long tongues, which can reach up to 45 centimeters, to strip
                    leaves from branches. They are gentle, social animals and usually live in loose herds. 
                    In the wild, giraffes have a lifespan of about 20 to 25 years.
