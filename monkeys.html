                <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                <p>Monkeys are a diverse group of primates found across Africa,
                Asia, and the Americas, inhabiting forests, grasslands,
                and even mountainous regions. Their species vary widely,
                including well-known types like capuchins, howler monkeys,
                and vervet monkeys. Monkeys are omnivores, eating a diet
                of fruits, insects, leaves, and sometimes small animals.
                Many monkey species are highly social and intelligent,
                with some using tools and exhibiting problem-solving skills.
                Some species, especially those in the Americas, have
                prehensile tails that function like an extra limb. Their
                lifespans can range from 10 to 45 years depending on the species.
