                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is a tree-dwelling
                marsupial native to eastern Australia. Often mistakenly
                called a "koala bear," the koala is not a bear but a
                marsupial, meaning it carries its young in a pouch.
                Koalas are known for their thick, fluffy fur, large
                round ears, and gentle appearance. They live in
                eucalyptus forests and feed almost exclusively on
                eucalyptus leaves, which are tough and low in nutrients.
                Because of their low-energy diet, koalas sleep up to
                18–22 hours a day to conserve energy. Koalas are solitary
                animals and have a strong sense of smell to help them
                select the best leaves. In the wild, they can live up
                to 10–15 years, but their populations are threatened
                by habitat loss, disease, and bushfires.
